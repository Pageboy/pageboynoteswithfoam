## From InDesign to HTML

See also [[From InDesign to HTML]]

Prep:

The requirements are that there should be  a minimum of 6 images to the HTML

**Optionally** you can add one video or audio to the HTML (this may be a direct addition of an mp4 file or an embed from YouTube or an added mp3 file.)

So it is easier to add in InDesign (anchored) although you can add later into the HTML
